         <h3>PAST PAPERS</h3>
         <p class="txt-j mt-4">
            Unfortunately, in Pakistan there is no platform which is providing clear, accurate, easily accessible, updated and timely information about universities, their criterion, programs they are offering and their respective enrollment dates and most Importantly the con-tent about the Entrance exams. Drivethru has resolved this problem of students in an effective and efficient manner by placing all the available past papers of almost every field on its website. <br>
            Few of the them are listed below:<br>
         <ul>
            <li>GAT (General, A, B,C,D)</li>
            <li>MCAT</li>
            <li>NAT (Medical, Engineering, Computer Science)</li>
            <li>ECAT</li>
            <li>NET</li>
         </ul>
         All other Universities past papers are also available on the website in the section of past papers. Students can have easy, free and fast access to this content and can easily win in this game of entrance exam. In most of the Universities, 25-50% paper is repeated from the last five years entrance exams so this feature is heavenly beneficial for the student. For International admissions, past
         papers are also available which includes: <br>
         <ul>
            <li>GMAT</li>
            <li>GRE</li>
            <li>IELTS</li>
            <li>TOEFL</li>
         </ul>

            Another problem they face is the complex, time consuming and lengthy admission Forms they have to fill for every university they are considering to apply for. And for the students who are looking to study abroad in renowned international universities may have to pay multiple visits to their consultants for their counselling and application processing which is very difficult in some situations.
         </p>
         <p class="mt-1">
            Drivethru has solved this problem of the students efficiently by introducing the facility of a unified application form on which the student enters the following details:
         </p>
         <ul>
            <li>Personal Details</li>
            <li>Education details</li>
            <li>Work details</li>
            <li>Admission details (where to apply)</li>
            <li>More documents may be asked (in case of need)</li>

         </ul>
         <p class="mt-1">
            By using this data, Drivethru will apply on the studentâ€™s behalf in all the Universities which student will select. Drivethru will take care of all the formalities that are required for admission and will provide the best possible ease and comfort to their students.
         </p>
         <p class="mt-1">
            For International admission, the case is very same. Student just need to select the Country, University and program they want to apply in from the website. Drivethru will carry the complete admission process for them, admission letter, Visa processing and their receiving at the airport in the host country, too. There are no charges made for this whole process except the one which are used in the process.
